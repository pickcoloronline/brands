  "description": "LoginRadius uses a sophisticated color palette to reflect its brand identity. The primary teal blue (008ECF) represents trust and digital innovation, while the dark navy shades (09263C and 020B13) convey professionalism and security. Soft accents of light blue (E3F1F8) and deep blue (073857) add a fresh and modern touch, highlighting the brand's focus on cutting-edge solutions. These colors are highlighted in their official blog post announcing their new brand look."
