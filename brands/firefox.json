  "description": "Firefox is known for its vibrant and dynamic color palette, which includes shades of orange like E66000 and FF9500, representing warmth and energy. The blues, such as 00539F and 0095DD, reflect trust and transparency. The deep purples, like 331E54, and navy, 002147, offer a sense of sophistication and stability. These colors are derived from the brand guidelines available on Mozilla's design and branding resources."
